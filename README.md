## Getting started <a name="1"></a>

In order for us to get started, I would like you to have these few things ready:

1. [A browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/), preferably Chrome, Strictly not internet explorer (ðŸ˜¡ anyone who uses it is an evil)!
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), it's like a notepad, but with more functionality for programmers
3. A passion to learn (Grab as much â˜• as you want, and take a short break if you felt it's overwhelming, remember, coffee = programmer)!

This article written by freeCodeCamp explains [How to Stay Motivated to Keep Learning to Code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-stay-motivated-to-keep-learning-to-code/), feel free to take a time to read it out!

## Introduction to Web Development <a name="2"></a>

Instead of writing it out, how about check out a video that we made to explain about this?

If everything goes well, you should have a rough understanding of what web development is, if you don't, no worries! Just learn as we go, that's how all the programmers learn --- build something!
