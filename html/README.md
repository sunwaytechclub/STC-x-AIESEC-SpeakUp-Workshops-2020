## Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

When it comes to the internet, nothing is more basic than Hypertext Markup Language ‚Äî known informally by almost everyone on the web as HTML.

Think of the whole Web development as building a house üèö,

To build a üèö, we need:

- A (or more) brick(s) üß±!

![brick](/html/assets/brick.jpg)

- Paint üñå!

![Paint](/html/assets/paint.jpg)

- Door, switches, etc

![Door](/html/assets/door.jpg) üö™

Each of them corresponding to:

- Hyper text markup language (HTML)
  - The structure of the website
- Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
  - The look and feel of the website
- Javascript (JS) - To open the door
  - The behaviours of the website (when you click the button, do actions)

We are focusing on building the structure of the house (The website), which will be the HTML.

Just a quick peak into how HTML looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```

In the example above, you can see that there are multiple `< >` with text in it, these are called **tags**

<br>
<br>

## Tags

Tags are like the lego block for html, generally, you can think of tags like the punctuation in english, we have ", !, ?, etc. But we only have `< >` in html as the only "punctuation".

### ExerciseüéΩ

It's better to action than speaking, why not we start our first hands-on of the workshop?

Are you ready üíÉ? Grab a coffee if you want!

#### General step break down

1. Create a file called `index.html` in your desktop (or any place!)
2. Open your Visual Studio Code and open the html file.
3. Type `<h1> I am a heading! </h1>`
4. Save it
5. Go to your file explorer / Finder and double click the file
6. Tadaaaa

#### Detailed step breakdown

1. Create a file called `index.html` in your desktop (or any place!)

    1.1 Create a txt file
    ![1](/html/assets/tags-1.0.PNG)

    1.2 Name it to `index.html`
    ![2](/html/assets/tags-1.1.PNG)

    1.3 You should see the icon of it became your favourite browser icon
    ![3](/html/assets/tags-1.2.PNG)

2. Open your Visual Studio Code and open the html file.

    2.1 Open your Visual Studio Code
    ![1](/html/assets/tags-2.1.jpg)

    2.2 Click on `file` and choose `Open File...`
    ![2](/html/assets/tags-2.2.jpg)

    2.3 Navigate to the `index.html` file you had just created and click `open`

    2.4 You should now see it open the empty `index.html` file
    ![3](/html/assets/tags-2.3.jpg)

3. Type `<h1> I am a heading! </h1>`
  ![1](/html/assets/tags-3.1.jpg)

4. Save it

    4.1 Press `ctrl` + `s` to save, or go to `File` > `Save`

    *Hint: If you see a white dot beside the file name on the tab, it means it is not saved.

5. Go to your file explorer / Finder and double click the file

  Ta daaaa

### Concepts Behind <a name="tags-concept"></a>

Let's recall the example code we had before:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```

Now, we have all these `<>` stuffs there, the primarily reason why we have it is to specify the opening and closing of the content for the browser to know, for example:

<br>

browser: `<h1>`? Oh he means what comes after is the heading text! I should render it as a heading text!

browser: *Render `This is a Heading` as heading text*

browser: `</h1>`? Oh he means this is the end of the content, I should stop render the following stuffs as heading text.

Now, let's break this down further

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - To let the browser know this is a html file
- `<html></html>` - To let the browser know whatever content in this tag are html elements
- `<head></head>` - Browser will take elements inside as as [metadata](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp#:~:text=The%20element%20is%20a,scripts%2C%20and%20other%20meta%20information.), don't worry about this yet, we will see this in later.
- `<body></body>` - Browser will render elements in this tag into the screen (Which is what you see in the exercise just now)
- `<title></title>` - Browser will use this as the title of the website, which will shown at your browser tab.
- `<h1></h1>` - Browser will take content in this tag as heading text, do be aware there are other sizes too like `<h2>`,`<h3>`,`<h4>`,`<h5>`.
- `<p></p>` - Browser will take content in this tag as paragraph text.

There are a tons of html tags out there, you can see it [here](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP)

But do you need to remember all like how we remember all like the periodic table?

You don't need to! Just take some of the [most commonly used html tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/) in mind, when you need it, just Google it and find it out!

[See, I am not the only one who tell you don't remember everything of it](https://www.quora.com/Do-I-have-to-memorize-all-the-codes-of-HTML-and-CSS-to-become-a-web-developer#:~:text=A%20Big%20no.,syntax%2C%20layout%2C%20and%20styling.)

### Summary

Tags are just like our double quotation mark, you tell the browser where it starts, where it ends, and what is the content.

### Challenge

Try to copy this code, replace with what you have in your `index.html` with Visual Studio Code, save it and reload on your browser!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
