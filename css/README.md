## What is Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) ðŸ¤”<a name="what"></a>

It's is basically a document that specify, how to style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing...) the HTML tags in custom way.

## Writing our first css ðŸ’ª <a name="firstcss"></a>

Let's open Visual Studio Code, create a file called "index.html" with the following Document Object Model:

![firstcss-1](/css/assets/firstcss-1.png)

Complete code:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first html website with css</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Output:

![firstcss-2](/css/assets/firstcss-2.jpg)
